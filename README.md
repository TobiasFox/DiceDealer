## Background  
Dice Dealer is a mobile application for Android and was developed during the first semester of the games master at the Hamburg University of Apllied Sciences. The objection was to implementing a game with a simple mechanic using one of the sensors provided by a smartphone. We chose the acceleration sensor to detect the shaking of a smartphone.
